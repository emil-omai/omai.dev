## Key Insights from Keynotes

### Humanity at the Center

One of the most memorable presentations focused on putting humanity at the center of AI development. The speaker emphasized the importance of creating solutions that enhance people rather than replace them.

This is exactly what we at Omai work with every day. We believe that AI should be a tool that helps people achieve their goals, not a threat to their work or identity.

### Private AI Becomes Increasingly Important

Another trend that emerged clearly was interest in private AI – solutions that can run locally without sending data to the cloud. This is especially important for organizations handling sensitive information.

## Networking and Collaborations

The conference also gave us the opportunity to meet many interesting people and organizations. We discussed potential collaborations and shared our vision of how AI can be used in a more human way.

Several organizations showed interest in our approach, especially our focus on the balance between technical precision and human warmth.

## What Does This Mean for the Future?

The conference confirmed that we are on the right track. AI development is moving fast, but there is a growing interest in solutions that prioritize people. This is exactly what Omai stands for.

We look forward to continuing to develop solutions that combine the latest technology with a genuine understanding of human needs.
